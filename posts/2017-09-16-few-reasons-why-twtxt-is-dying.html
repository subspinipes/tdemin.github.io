      <p>So, the Ripper is now going for twtxt.</p>
      <p>twtxt, at its core, is an amazingly simple microblogging platform. Its idea is
        to blog by simply appending lines to a publicly available text file hosted
        somewhere on the Internet. Simple is better, you know? Even the author of this
        post <a href="/blog.txt" title="@tdemin on twtxt">used to use</a> twtxt for microblogging.</p>
      <p>Despite its total simplicity, the population of twtxt is slowly disappearing.
        There are <a href="https://enotty.dk/we-are-twtxt.txt">3 latest additions vs 6 latest deletions</a>
        (starting with me) on the <a href="https://github.com/mdom/we-are-twtxt">we-are-twtxt</a> register, and now there
        are just 45 guys on the list, only 10 of which occasionally tweet nowadays. 
        Looks like a dusk for twtxt.</p>
      <p>I think I have the points, why is this going on.</p>
      <h3 id="point-1-the-process-of-discovering-existing-users">Point #1, the process of discovering existing users</h3>
      <p>As far as twtxt doc only specifies the file format for text-based microblogging,
        it misses lots of important things, and the first one on the list is the users
        discovery process.</p>
      <p>You may say, “Ha! It’s easy to provide folks with a link on my site!”, but…
        exactly, you’d probably be the only one who thinks about this. Yes, just three
        <abbr title="FYI, it's me, @c-keen and @freemor">folks</abbr> from the top 10
        active users on twtxt have published a link pointing to their microblog file on
        their sites, and <em>those links are yet to be found</em> by a newcomer.</p>
      <p>There is a public <a href="https://github.com/mdom/we-are-twtxt">registry</a> for twtxt, but the existence of such
        a registry just makes the <em>process of discovery being very hard</em> evident.</p>
      <p>The other side of the discovery being hard is the technical one. RSS/Atom feeds
        are standartized formats that are pointed to by the webpages with a special tag:</p>
      <div class="highlighter-rouge">
        <div class="highlight">
          <pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;link rel="alternate" type="application/atom+xml" href="atom.xml"&gt;
</code></pre>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p><span class="contentComment">Example Atom feed link</span></p>
      <p>This makes discovering the feeds by search engines and news readers very easy
        and streamlined, as you just enter the site URL into your favorite news reader
        app and a news feed is instantly found.</p>
      <p>What can twtxt oppose RSS or Atom with? <em>Nothing</em>. There just isn’t a standard
        way to find a twtxt microblog for a crawler.</p>
      <p>So, the only way to find guys on twtxt is a special registry. Magnificent, it’s
        already hard to use for a new guy.</p>
      <h3 id="point-2-the-quality-of-apps-suggested-for-end-users">Point #2, the quality of apps suggested for end users</h3>
      <p>Let’s imagine ourselves as we were a newcomer starting twtxt for the first time
        (I’m now speaking of the <a href="https://github.com/buckket/twtxt">initial program</a> by buckket). What command
        shall we issue at first? Right, it’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">twtxt quickstart</code>.</p>
      <p>When we get to the file location chooser, we might want to store our twtxt files
        in a new non-existent directory (I like <code class="highlighter-rouge">~/.local/share/twtxt</code>, but you are free
        to choose whatever you want). What will twtxt respond with? Right, with a crash.
        Nice, we’ve just started an app, and it already began crashing on quickstart.</p>
      <p>BTW, this bug <a href="https://github.com/buckket/twtxt/commit/c1bbd6aa7f059a9382ea149528baeb05579ef019">was fixed</a>, but a version with that fix was never
        released, so <em>a newbie will end up installing the program with critical bugs</em>.
        Isn’t this awesome?</p>
      <p>I haven’t checked other apps, but I’m sure there are bugs, lots of them. Can’t
        even imagine what would break in an average twtxt client if an official one
        fails on creating a directory for the twtxt file.</p>
      <h3 id="point-3-the-process-of-signing-up">Point #3, the process of signing up</h3>
      <p>There actually isn’t one. Signing up is as easy as creating a publicly available
        text file, that’s the biggest point of twtxt. But, well, <em>how do we exactly</em>
        <em>make a file available to anyone on the Internet</em>?</p>
      <p>We have a few variants to achieve this:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Hosting a file on something like GitHub Pages. We’ll have to sign up for
          GitHub first, create a repo, push our file… did I miss “learning how to work
          with Git”? Yeah, that was an extraordinary simple one (is this sentence even
          ironic?).</li>
        <li>Hosting a file on a free hosting site. We’ll have to sign up on a site, learn
          how to work with FTP… damn it, that’s too hard again.</li>
        <li>Placing a file in <a href="https://ipfs.io" title="A distributed file system">IPFS</a> or <a href="https://keybase.io" title="A promising web service. Provides some nice capabilities for PGP and its KBFS">KBFS</a>. Requires some madskillz
          for installation and usage.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Three variants (I’m sure there are others, just not sure what are those), all of
        which require to install something odd, learn to work with that something odd…
        in other words, do those complex geeky things nobody wants to actually do.</p>
      <p><em>An extra layer of complex actions required just to sign up won’t attract</em>
        <em>anyone</em>. Just those with super powers would pass.</p>
      <h3 id="point-4-and-the-most-obvious-one-the-population-of-twtxt">Point #4, and the most obvious one: the population of twtxt</h3>
      <p>OK, so we’ve come across the buggy apps and imported the we-are-twtxt registry
        into some app. What are we going to read now?</p>
      <p>Did I say only those who have super powers (i.e. geeks, techies, etc) would use
        twtxt? This is perfectly right, there aren’t any categories of people not
        falling into the ones listed above. So, the <em>timeline is flooded with the</em>
        <em>things not interesting to an average user</em>—just things like decentralization,
        software, technology and stuff are discussed on twtxt. Hello? There are many
        more topics to discuss!</p>
      <h3 id="the-conclusion">The conclusion</h3>
      <p>twtxt is not accessible for most users due to its complexity hiding in its
        simplicity (this looks rather strange, but it’s true). Its population is already
        dwindling, so the entire network is going to die after some time, even though
        twtxt is just 1.5 years old.</p>
      <p>It’s a pity, but it’s true.</p>
