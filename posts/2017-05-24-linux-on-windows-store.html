      <p>As you probably know, Windows 10 Anniversary Update <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about" title="Windows Subsystem for Linux">brought</a> the whole
        Ubuntu set of userspace utilities and libraries to run <em>unmodified</em> on Windows
        platform. This is considered a nice new feature intended to
        <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/faq" title="Windows Subsystem for Linux FAQ">be used by developers</a>.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>This is primarily a tool for developers — especially web developers and those
          who work on or with open source projects. This allows those who want/need to use
          Bash, common Linux tools (sed, awk, etc.) and many Linux-first tools (Ruby,
          Python, etc.) to use their toolchain on Windows.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><span class="contentComment">From WSL FAQ</span></p>
      <p>On May 11 it was announced Ubuntu and other Linux distros are coming soon to
        Windows Store, the marketplace for Windows apps. This means significant
        improvements to the WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) platform and its usage
        being streamlined for casual users and developers. But, well, <em>will this really</em>
        <em>support Linux</em> as an operating system for desktops?</p>
      <p>Linux distros are somewhat considered to be a free alternative to Windows on
        your desktop so you always have a choice. However, Linux on desktops still has
        problems (<a href="https://itvision.altervista.org/why.linux.is.not.ready.for.the.desktop.current.html" title="Why Linux is Not Ready for the Desktop">this page</a> will probably summarize things better
        than me), a big bunch of problems that tends to stop users adopting alternate
        operating systems. The number of its desktop users is still low (in fact,
        <a href="https://linux.slashdot.org/story/16/07/02/184229/linux-grabs-more-than-2-of-desktop-market-share" title="Linux Grabs More than 2% of Desktop Market Share">it recently hit just 2%</a> of desktop market share), so some software
        developers don’t even think of porting their software under Linux or *BSD,
        considering testing compability with Wine (e.g. developers of Lightshot, a
        screenshot tool, <a href="https://app.prntscr.com/en/download.html">say</a> they’re testing compability with Wine under
        Ubuntu, though there are tons of native screenshot utilities you can use).</p>
      <p>If Linux distros start being rolled out as Windows Store apps, an average user
        might drop alternate operating systems completely, as neither developers nor
        users no longer want them — they already have the stuff they need at their
        fingertips. Alternative systems market share falls, Microsoft receives a number
        of former Linux users and gets the market covered again.</p>
      <p>If you really want to support software freedom and if you care about the users
        to have an alternative, try a free operating system on your desktop instead of
        using WSL. Even if you don’t support free software by other means, the number of
        users will eventually grow to the point free software will shine on your desktop
        again.</p>
