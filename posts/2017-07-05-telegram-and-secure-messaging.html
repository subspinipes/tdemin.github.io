      <p>Telegram, as it states on its home page, is a secure messenger. Over the years
        it became a simple, powerful multi-device messenger which is selected as the
        main messaging platform by many people (the official Android app has more than
        <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.telegram.messenger">100 million installs</a>, for example).</p>
      <p>Many people say Telegram really <em>is</em> a secure messenger. They trust Pavel Durov,
        its creator, they get overwhelmed with its promotion, they get obsessed. I will
        try to dissolve Telegram as a secure messenger suitable for private messaging
        from the end user’s point of view.</p>
      <p>So, let’s start with the main promotional Telegram’s feature which was heavily
        advertised — the secret chats.</p>
      <h3 id="secret-chats">Secret chats</h3>
      <p>Secret chats is the way Telegram does end-to-end encryption on your messages.
        They are said to leave no trace on Telegram’s servers and to be not available to
        them. This is the recommended way to message securely on Telegram.</p>
      <p>However, they are pretty unconvenient, as you have to start them by hand. They
        also have a few problems that make their usage painful.</p>
      <p><em>Secret chats don’t work on multiple devices</em>. According to
        <a href="https://telegram.org/faq#q-how-are-secret-chats-different" title="How are Secret Chats Different?">Telegram FAQ</a>, the secret chats are device-specific and can be opened
        only from device they were created from. We now can already conclude the secret
        chats are not scalable (or why would someone limit their usage to only one
        device?), so are not suitable for convenient messaging.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>All secret chats in Telegram are device-specific and are not part of the
          Telegram cloud. This means you can only access messages in a secret chat from
          their device of origin.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Messengers really caring about end-to-end encryption of its clients should
        provide the way to somehow synchronize encrypted chats, or such feature would
        not be used by masses. For example, Signal Protocol, the cryptographic protocol
        used by Signal, does scale, so as its port to XMPP, <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0384.html" title="XEP-0384: OMEMO Encryption">OMEMO</a>, and
        <a href="https://github.com/wireapp/proteus">Proteus</a>, the port made for Wire messenger. They achieve multi-device
        encryption by encrypting the message separately for every recipient device.</p>
      <p><em>Secret chats don’t allow you to start chats at any time</em>. You’ll have to wait
        for the recipient to become online to send him encrypted messages on Telegram,
        when you don’t need this if using protocols designed to provide offline messages
        delivery, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_Protocol">Signal Protocol</a>, which was already mentioned
        above.</p>
      <p>Telegram’s secret chats are like OTR in XMPP — an old encryption protocol that
        doesn’t allow you to neither synchronize messages nor send messages to offline
        devices.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>OTR has significant usability drawbacks for inter-client mobility. As OTR
          sessions exist between exactly two clients, the chat history will not be
          synchronized across other clients of the involved parties. Furthermore, OTR
          chats are only possible if both participants are currently online, due to how
          the rolling key agreement scheme of OTR works.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><span class="contentComment">Introduction to XEP-0384, the motivation to replace
          OTR</span></p>
      <p><em>Secret chats don’t work on Telegram Desktop</em>. Here comes another problem of the
        secret chats — they are only available on the mobile phones (and on the Telegram
        client from App Store). Telegram Desktop, the official Telegram app for Windows,
        macOS and Linux, doesn’t support secret chats, while this feature was first
        requested at <a href="https://github.com/telegramdesktop/tdesktop/issues/5">June 1, 2014</a>. There were many requests since then
        (<a href="https://github.com/telegramdesktop/tdesktop/issues/118">1</a>, <a href="https://github.com/telegramdesktop/tdesktop/issues/619">2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/telegramdesktop/tdesktop/issues/871">3</a>, etc), but secret chats are still
        unimplemented as of Jule 5 in the official desktop app of the messenger which
        claims itself secure.</p>
      <p><em>Secret chats don’t work in group chats</em>. You can’t end-to-end encrypt Telegram
        group chats at all, that’s it. If you want to chat with many people at once
        securely… you can’t, forget it. The E2EE protocol of Telegram doesn’t allow
        you to group chat securely, when modern protocols, like Signal Protocol,
        actually allow you to, by the technique already stated above — encrypting
        messages to every recipient separately.</p>
      <p><em>Secret chats just aren’t usable</em>. The whole secret chats thing just does it the
        wrong way. As Telegram’s secret chats are not really suitable for multi-device
        environment and do not allow you to use them in group chats, and you have to
        force them by hand, you probably won’t use them at all, therefore your messages
        will be easily available to Telegram.</p>
      <h3 id="mtproto-security">MTProto security</h3>
      <p>Any security protocol should be independently audited to be trusted on being
        secure. MTProto, the homegrown encryption protocol used by Telegram to encrypt
        messages, wasn’t audited, but instead a <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/cryptocontest" title="$300000 for Cracking Telegram Encryption">challenge was posted</a> by
        Pavel Durov to crack the secret chat he started with his brother.</p>
      <p>The lack of winners noted by Pavel Durov is the thing he mostly admires when
        claiming the protocol security. Why is a marketing promotional better than
        an independent expert audit which would state things better? We only have to
        guess and hope the protocol is really secure.</p>

      <p><span class="contentComment">XKCD #153</span></p>
      <h3 id="spreading-fear-and-doubt">Spreading fear and doubt</h3>
      <p>Pavel Durov recently <a href="https://twitter.com/durov/status/872891017418113024" title="The encryption of Signal (=WhatsApp, FB) was funded by the US Government. I predict a backdoor will be found there within 5 years from now.">stated</a> the encryption of Signal was funded by
        US government, so the backdoor is predicted to be found in 5 years.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>The encryption of Signal (=WhatsApp, FB) was funded by the US Government. I predict a backdoor will be found there within 5 years from now.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The development of a new crypto is a hard task to accomplish. The cryptoexperts
        funded by the governments know there shouldn’t be any backdoors, as any security
        tamper used by “good guys” can eventually be used by “bad guys”.</p>
      <p>If the protocol is sound from the bad guys, it is safe and sound from anyone, so
        predicting the protocol to be found vulnerable in just 5 years sounds more like
        spreading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt" title="Fear, uncertainty and doubt">FUD</a> among people to help promoting Telegram. Not only it
        doesn’t look like a fair play, it’s a very dangerous thing to do as people
        trusting Durov probably will just abandon on things after such statements.</p>
      <p><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/security_advice.png" alt="XKCD #1820" title="Security Advice" /></p>
      <p><span class="contentComment">XKCD #1820. Just how Durov does</span></p>
      <p>Undermining the competitors isn’t a good thing to do. Undermining them with
        spreading FUD among people is even worse.</p>
      <h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
      <p>Let’s summarize the things we’ve learned:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Telegram uses its own cryptographic protocol, which hasn’t been audited by
          third-parties, but instead was starred in an advertisement promotional;</li>
        <li>Telegram’s secret chats are not scalable, do not allow to sync messages and
          do not apply to group chats;</li>
        <li>there isn’t an implementation of Telegram’s end-to-end encryption in the 
          official desktop client;</li>
        <li>there isn’t any proof the Telegram servers do not spoof on messages except for
          its creator’s statements;</li>
        <li>Telegram’s creator makes FUD statements to promote his own service and
          undermine the competitors.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you’re going to use Telegram for secure messaging, you’ll have to trust it on
        being secure, and there are many signs you shouldn’t. So, why don’t you make a
        change if you want a private messenger? There are already a few secure
        messengers on the market that allow you to chat securely while handling things
        like multiple devices much better than Telegram does, like <a href="https://wireapp.com">Wire</a> or
        <a href="https://whispersystems.org">Signal</a>.</p>
      <hr />
      <p><em>Note</em>: Telegram previously didn’t update their Android and iOS apps code
        regularly and this didn’t look good for a program under GNU GPLv2. Since v4.1.1,
        they started to publish the code on a regular basis. The development process is
        still closed-doors, though.</p>
