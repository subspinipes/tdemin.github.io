      <p>The more I watch YouTube videos, the more I see channels, which owners beg you
        to tap the bell located close to “Subscribe” button. It is common for them to
        specify YouTube is laggy, notifications don’t always work, etc.</p>
      <p>In a few words — don’t do it. Not only YouTube is operating normally, but this
        bell enables 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push_Notification">push notifications</a> for
        channel notifications. Or, in other words, your phone/tablet connected to your
        Google account will receive every single notification of channel events as soon
        as it arrives.</p>
      <p>This means your phone will ring every time another man releases a new video.
        He/she could release it at any time, and your device would notify you even if
        it’s night, and you’re sleeping tight in your bed. Most people don’t bother with
        setting up notifications levels and Do not Disturb, so your device will probably
        ring at full volume. Do you want it? I doubt so.</p>
      <p>If you click the bell as the channel owner begs you, you’ll only suffer from
        that click. Don’t do it.</p>
