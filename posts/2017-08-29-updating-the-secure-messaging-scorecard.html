      <p>The <a href="/posts/2017-07-28-releasing-the-secure-messaging-scorecard">previous version</a> of the Secure Messaging Scorecard did a good job
        on comparing the messengers on their ability on securely messaging people. So
        far this was the most important feature to compare the messengers on.</p>
      <p>While secure messaging <em>is</em> a great point, I felt that the scorecard missed the
        point on the featurefulness of the messengers compared. Moreover, XMPP was
        highly praised and received a very good score, while its modern clients mostly
        miss convenient things like phone calls and voice messaging, the things popular
        messengers already have.</p>
      <p>A full feature comparison would go away from secure messaging, so I decided to
        pick the most needful ones: sending files, audio and video calling.</p>
      <p>This quickly changed things. XMPP, with having a few standards on sending files
        whilst having no mobile clients able to call, withdrew its position and fell
        back, allowing more usable messengers to get a better score and a better
        position.</p>
      <p>So far so good, now it’s a much more honest comparison—it respects the features
        you want from an instant messaging client while retaining the main point it was
        created for, the secure messaging.</p>
      <p>The update also includes a few score fixes. Google Allo finally received a
        <a href="https://allo.google.com/web">desktop client</a> (BTW it only works with Chrome), ChatSecure is known
        to <a href="https://github.com/ChatSecure/ChatSecure-iOS/issues/580">have no support</a> for encrypted group chats, etc.</p>

      <p>As always, you’re welcome to <a href="mailto:demintimur@gmail.com">email me</a>, if you
        have any comments.</p>

      <p><em>Note</em>: the embedded version of the scorecard doesn’t include comments on how
        the score was decided. To view the comments and get the reason behind the final
        score, see <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mZ0GNopaUB1N6JIundx17EyheN9R_uhpKxrn8-2So-E/edit?usp=sharing">full document</a>.</p>

      <p><em>Update 1, September 12, 2017</em>: you can now start encrypted group chats with
        Google Allo. Its score is raised by 5.</p>
      <p><em>Update 2, September 21, 2017</em>: Wire’s server’s got <a href="https://medium.com/@wireapp/wire-server-code-now-100-open-source-the-journey-continues-88e24164309c">opensourced</a>.</p>
      <p><em>Update 3, October 6, 2017</em>: Allo is now not sticked to Chrome. Score for
        sending files in OTR-encrypted XMPP chats was lowered to 2.5 due to the files
        being not encrypted if SI is used.</p>
