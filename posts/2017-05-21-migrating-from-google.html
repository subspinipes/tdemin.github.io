      <p>I’ve never thought it would be really hard to stop using Google services until
        today.</p>
      <p>I now have to somehow replace:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>my calendar app. Google Calendar is a simple-to-use app, and its Goals is a
          real killer feature, as the schedule somehow adapts to you. The way reminders
          and stuff created via Google App integrate into your calendar is also a charm. I
          have no idea how do I replace it all, but using GNOME Calendar seems to be…
          sustainable?</li>
        <li>task list app. Taskwarrior is fine, right, but, well, does it really integrate
          with GNOME desktop? Using it on Android is also questionable, as I want
          something simplier to use.</li>
        <li>notes app. Do you know any free software which allows you to synchronize notes
          and reminders while integrating in your calendar and reminders? I don’t, so I
          have to use Google Keep, and I doubt I could replace it.</li>
        <li>email. Well, that’s the least problem of all, however, I’ll still have to tune
          my new mailbox to be easy-to-use and filter stuff well, just like Gmail does.</li>
        <li>printing system. I occasionally use Cloud Print, and I still don’t know a way
          to use CUPS on my phone.</li>
        <li>my web browser. If I stop using Google services, I don’t have to use
          Chrome/Chromium either, right? Firefox is alright, I presume? Didn’t use it for
          years.</li>
        <li>sync. I’m speaking primarily of Google Photos, which gives you unlimited
          storage for your pics. If I want to abandon Google, I would search for a
          decentralized analogue, not MEGA or something promising you to keep your files
          private. Well… perhaps I’ll find a good alternative some day.</li>
        <li>Play Services. Anyone knows how do I receive WhatsApp notifications while
          using Doze and not using Play Services?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You know, migrating from proprietary services and software is hard, and that’s
        the reason you shouldn’t use them anyway. A proprietary ecosystem will take your
        stuff and won’t let you go away easily.</p>
