      <p>Preserving compatibility with legacy products has always been a PITA. The
        developers who preserve compatibility with other products sometimes notice they
        cannot implement feature X because it breaks Y for some users.</p>
      <p>It is less problematic for those who provide a centralized service with some
        client software to use the service with. Sometimes such services even deny
        alternate clients or software because it would break things for other users
        (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/LibreSignal/LibreSignal">LibreSignal</a>, a deblobbed variant of Signal private
        messenger, was stopped due to Moxie’s disagreement of LibreSignal’s usage of
        Signal servers). Moxie Marlinspike, head of <a href="https://whispersystems.org/">Open Whisper Systems</a>, the
        Signal developers, has even written <a href="https://whispersystems.org/blog/the-ecosystem-is-moving/" title="The Ecosystem Is Moving">an article</a> stating
        his opinion on user experience in decentralized environments or the environments
        where alternative clients are enabled.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Indeed, cannibalizing a federated application-layer protocol into a
          centralized service is almost a sure recipe for a successful consumer product
          today. It’s what Slack did with IRC, what Facebook did with email, and what
          WhatsApp has done with XMPP. In each case, the federated service is stuck in
          time, while the centralized service is able to iterate into the modern world and
          beyond.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Daniel Gultsch, the head developer of another instant messaging client,
        <a href="https://conversations.im/">Conversations</a>, has <a href="https://gultsch.de/objection.html" title="An Objection to ‘The ecosystem is moving’">replied</a> to Moxie’s post stating
        <em>the biggest problem of federated networks</em> and their user experience is not
        them being stuck in time, but the <em>lack of developers</em> able to maintain
        user-friendly IM solutions.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Instead the most frequent reason new features don’t get implement is a lack of
          resources. The majority of end-user-facing XMPP implementations are developed by
          people in their spare time.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The lack of manpower is surely a problem for the federated systems as they do
        not always receive as much attention as they really need. But, well, <em>is the</em>
        <em>lack of manpower really the biggest problem</em> of the federated solutions?</p>
      <h3 id="a-look-at-xmpp">A look at XMPP</h3>
      <p><a href="https://xmpp.org/" title="Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol">XMPP</a>, the protocol mentioned in both articles, is complete with its
        extensions, so-called <abbr title="XMPP Extension Protocols">XEPs</abbr>. The
        number of extensions present nowadays is pretty overwhelming: there are ≈
        <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/index.html">400 extensions</a> reviewed by XSF. Those extent the protocol with features
        you see in modern messengers: sending files, retrieving message archive, etc.</p>
      <p>An ideal server/client should probably support most extensions that are
        up-to-date and which are useful. But the number of XMPP extensions is really
        big, so the most urgent ones are implemented first.</p>
      <p>Those protocol extensions are written at the time they are needed. An average
        extension which was a big technological advance yesterday could become obsolete
        in a few years, so as it became with a bunch of current XMPP extensions like
        XEP-0136.</p>
      <p>XMPP users somehow adopted the way being stuck in time, and most clients that
        are present include the archaisms like chat tabs (even the most up-to-date
        mobile XMPP client, Conversations, still uses that tabs concept), while modern
        messengers like WhatsApp and Telegram just show the chats list, none of which is
        hidden until the message history is expunged. Some of the actively used clients
        still don’t even support message syncing between online clients (i.e. Tkabber),
        not to mention “advanced” extensions like session resumption or message
        corrections. However, those clients are still used and are even recommended by
        some.</p>
      <p>Those archaisms are actively supported by the users
        (<a href="https://github.com/Vacuum-IM/vacuum-im/issues/864#issuecomment-139908478">this GitHub thread</a> would probably explain things better than
        me: a legacy server user is protecting his beloved XEP-0136, which is already
        dropped by the two major XMPP server software bundles: Prosody and ejabberd due
        to its difficulty to maintain). And these <em>archaisms are stopping</em> not only 
        <em>the clients to develop</em>, but the modern way of <em>user experience</em>, which is not
        adopted due to the old users’ demands.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>I think we have much more important tasks than implementing experimental XEPs.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><span class="contentComment">@yagiza on GitHub</span></p>
      <p>Getting not enough manpower isn’t the only big XMPP problem. Another of its
        <em>big problems</em> is <em>its users</em>, who are freezing the clients development because
        of their beloved old client/server not supporting new features.</p>
      <h3 id="another-glance-at-riot">Another glance at Riot</h3>
      <p><a href="https://riot.im">Riot</a>, an instant messaging client built on top of <a href="https://matrix.org">Matrix</a>, 
        which is promoted by many as an alternative to Slack and XMPP both, is slowly
        starting to face the same problem from the rear side.</p>
      <p>One of the best things about Riot is its idea to be a <em>shared workplace for the</em>
        <em>web</em>. Riot integrates with XMPP, Slack and IRC by using special bridges
        attached to the channels. The drawback is, those bridges are meant just to
        connect people from various networks, so they don’t provide new Matrix features.
        Those bridges not only render advanced Riot features like multi-device
        end-to-end encryption unusable, they break things for other participants: <em>no</em>
        <em>one can even say an IRC bridge user is online or not</em>, and I didn’t even
        mention things like read receipts et al.</p>
      <p><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/team_chat.png" alt="XKCD #1782: Team Chat" title="XKCD #1782: Team Chat" /></p>
      <p><span class="contentComment">XKCD #1782</span></p>
      <p>There are still lots of people who use IRC, so some Matrix/Riot rooms are mostly
        accessed by IRC bridges users. However, you need only one IRC user in the room
        to break advanced Riot features for other users and render chats the same way it
        was in XMPP, just in a glossy new client.</p>
      <p>Riot is another example where the decentralization and freedom of choice just
        render awesome features unusable due to them being inaccessible to alternate
        clients users.</p>
      <p><span class="contentHighlight">
          This is not the decentralization nature of federated networks who buries them.
          This is not the lack of manpower who buries the protocols and the networks.
          Those who are responsible for considering their protocol dead are the users themselves.
        </span></p>
      <p>No one is responsible for making your instant messaging solution dead, but it’s
        just you. Think of it when you try to support that old legacy client built in
        2006 just because you know many guys who still use it.</p>
