      <p>Finding a good application to use for secure messaging nowadays may be a hard
        thing to do, because lots of them say they are secure and don’t snoop on you.
        The <a href="https://eff.org">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> realised that and tried to make up a
        scorecard that would compare messengers and show which are good for security and
        which aren’t. <a href="https://www.eff.org/node/82654" title="Secure Messaging Scorecard">This scorecard</a> was a basic comparation that didn’t include
        lots of things necessary to decide on the actual security of an app.</p>
      <p>This scorecard aims to include those details. Those are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the open code. You should be able to investigate into anything you use for
          security;</li>
        <li>the limitations of end-to-end encryption. Some apps have limited functionality
          when being used for end-to-end encryption on messages;</li>
        <li>the user interface design. An ugly app won’t attract people to use it;</li>
        <li>the architecture. Most of the solutions presented are centralized, but
          centralization sometimes isn’t good;</li>
        <li>…and others.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>So, this is it, the Secure Messaging Scorecard, enhanced by me.</p>
